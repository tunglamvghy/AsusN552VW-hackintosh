## [Donate me](https://paypal.me/vtlam98)
I'll try to keep this repo up-to-date BUT as a student, I need to pay a lot of fees: tuition fees, exam fees, house rent, food, etc.
Any donation would help me a lot!
***Due to COVID-19, now I have freetime. So if you want me to create your own EFI with a little payment, contact me via Telegram.***
